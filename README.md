# Pokemon
A random assortment of code to analyze pokemon
In visualization I am building up functions that will allow me to simulate various aspects of the game, and see how things work in interesting ways to later do bigger projects.

The first small step was developing plots for exp growth groups. Pokemon fall into one of 6 exp growth groups: Fast, Medium Fast, Medium Slow, Slow, Fluctuating, and Erratic. Pokemon levels range from 1-100, but can often be caught at various levels in the game. The level of a pokemon has a direct effect on the stats of a pokemon, so in addition to comparing things like exp to level up, and exp distributions, I also included a comparison of exp to stat values. I found for certain pokemon, even if your level might be significantly lower you may still wish to have a Slow growing pokemon. 

Of course move choice will matter as well so decisions can't be made solely on this.

Next I built a catch calculator, that simulates and models the catching of a wild pokemon. This is complex since many various and seemingly unrelated aspects of the game take part due to the large number of pokeballs and their various effects. More formatting is required for this code.
